**1. Why not verify on ChatTriggers?**

The module was getting too large and I did not want to annoy them with verifying it. You can still use the version on ChatTriggers, but I just won't be updating that one.


**2. LF Rats**

There will not be any rats, but I am as trustworthy as the next person so take that what you will. Be sure to use trusted rat scanners such as [isthisarat.com](https://isthisarat.com/), or [RatRatter 2.0](https://ktibow.github.io/RatRater2/) to scan your JAR files for rats.


**3. Setup did not work**

- Check if you placed correct folder in correct location. Run `/ct files`, click modules, click VolcAddons, and verify you see multiple files and folders.

- Make sure you are using ChatTriggers v2.2.0

- Run `/ct console js`


**4. "Missing arguments! Usage: /viewauction <auction id>"**

- Another mod is turn `/va` into a shortcut for `/viewauction`. You should still be able to use `/volc`.
